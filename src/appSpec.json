The 'secondary' color serves as a grounding tone for backgrounds, text blocks, and navigation elements, paired with 'secondaryForeground' for text to maintain contrast and warmth. The 'background' color provides a neutral, soft canvas that balances the stronger colors and supports content legibility. The 'highlightYellow' custom color is best used for large background sections or accent areas to create visual interest and break up the layout. Colors should be combined thoughtfully to maintain strong contrast and accessibility, with 'primary' and 'secondary' colors never used together without sufficient spacing or neutral buffer.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primaryForeground' on 'primary' background meets WCAG AA standards for large text and AAA for normal text. The 'secondaryForeground' on 'secondary' background also meets WCAG AA contrast ratios for body text. The 'background' color paired with 'secondary' and 'primary' colors provides sufficient contrast for readability. The 'highlightYellow' should be used with 'secondary' or 'primaryForeground' text to maintain accessibility compliance."

  "initialPrompt": "Sign Language Recognition Project\n\nProject Overview\nThe Sign Language Recognition Project aims to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and speech-impaired community and the general public by leveraging computer vision and machine learning technologies. This system recognizes hand gestures used in sign language and translates them into readable text or audible speech in real time.\n\nObjectives\n\n* Enable accurate recognition of sign language gestures\n* Provide real-time translation into text or speech\n* Promote inclusive communication using modern AI solutions\n\nKey Features\n\n* Real-time hand gesture detection\n* Machine learning-based gesture classification\n* User-friendly web interface\n* High accuracy and fast response time\n* Supports commonly used sign language alphabets/gestures\n\nTechnologies Used\n\n* Python\n* OpenCV\n* Machine Learning / Deep Learning\n* TensorFlow / Keras\n* Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)\n\nImpact\nThis project helps empower individuals with hearing and speech disabilities by enabling smoother communication, fostering inclusivity, and demonstrating how artificial intelligence can solve real-world social challenges.\n\nUse Cases\n\n* Education\n  Enables students with hearing or speech impairments to communicate effectively with teachers and classmates in schools, colleges, and online learning platforms.\n\n* Healthcare Services\n  Assists patients in conveying symptoms and concerns to healthcare professionals without the need for a human interpreter.\n\n* Customer Support & Public Services\n  Helps individuals communicate at banks, government offices, retail stores, and customer service centers through real-time sign-to-text translation.\n\n* Workplace Communication\n  Facilitates smoother interaction between employees and employers, promoting inclusive and accessible work environments.\n\n* Online Communication & Video Conferencing\n  Integrates with video calls to translate sign language into text or speech during virtual meetings.\n\n* Daily Conversations\n  Supports everyday interactions between sign language users and non-signers, enhancing independence and confidence.",
